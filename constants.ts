// Note: Type-related constants like GENRE_VALUES_FOR_TYPE are managed in types.ts
// and AVAILABLE_GENRES (which uses GENRE_VALUES_FOR_TYPE) is exported from ./constants/world.ts
// to prevent circular dependencies.
// The EquipmentSlotConfig in types.ts directly imports from './constants/translations' for its labelKey type
// to also avoid circular dependencies.
